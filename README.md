Going to try to create a wrapper around Blender in Linux to handle gesture inputs using a modified 1$ algorithm in order to be able to use my touchscreen laptop more effectively with Blender.  With cool command gestures.  Hopefully spawn some sort of community wanting free and open source extensions to a working environment that allows you to achieve great things with modern kit.

On Optimus laptops (Intel onboard GPU + NVIDIA dedicated GPU) I want the onboard GPU to handle the display whilst the CUDA-enabled NVIDIA tech can drive rendering in Cycles.  Rendering in Eeevee should happen using the CPU, allowing this mode to be easily used on a laptop on a train, for instance, without having to worry about chewing battery.

Whoops.
